ExplicitCAD is a minimal graphical user interface for [ImplicitCAD](https://github.com/colah/ImplicitCAD). 

It has a text editor, an output log, and a 3D viewer. 2D output is not currently supported.

Dependencies: 'qt5', 'libqscintilla'.

To compile, run 'qmake', and then 'make'.

To use, put the extopenscad binary in the same directory as the explicitcad binary.

Press F5 to render a preview, press F6 to render a final object. Resolution is currently hardcoded.

The text editor is an instance of [QScintilla](https://qscintilla.com/). The 3D viewer is an instance of [fstl](https://github.com/mkeeter/fstl).

fstl's license is as follows. I believe it is compatible with GPLv3:
